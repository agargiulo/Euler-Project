 * Problem 349
 * -----------
 * An ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured
 *          either black or white. The ant is always oriented in one of the
 *          cardinal directions (left, right, up or down) and moves from square
 *          to adjacent square according to the following rules: - if it is on a
 *          black square, it flips the color of the square to white, rotates 90
 *          degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one square. - if it is on
 *          a white square, it flips the color of the square to black, rotates
 *          90 degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.
 * 
 *          Starting with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are
 *          black after 1018 moves of the ant?
