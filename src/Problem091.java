 *          The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was
 *          discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form
 *          (2^6972593)-1; it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently
 *          other Mersenne primes, of the form (2^p)-1, have been found which
 *          contain more digits.
 * 
 *          However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which
 *          contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433×(2^7830457)+1.
 * 
 *          Find the last ten digits of this prime number.
